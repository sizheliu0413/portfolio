        <p>This video is made as a cultural critique to reveal that how technology impact human's life by showing people are on their cellphone in different kinds of occasion: shopping mall, restuarant, library, even in the car.</p>

          <p>The idea of this video is to give the eyes a "filter" to let people see what they could not see in their normal life. My installation is showing three different vision of what visual impairment people see and what regular vision people see in the same view : Standard eyesight viewing, short sighted viewing and color blindness viewing.</p>

        <p>I remember when I was in middle school, everyone has their own "website" that comes from a common software called "QQ", and people usually put their journals, photos, etc. However, most people don't use and post things there anymore even it still exists. For this project, I bring the style back here, which is neat and clean. And also, I insert the same thing that I liked to put in that web page, which is all about my favorite singer, JJ Lin.</p>

        <p>Most company are collecting data while you are using the internet, so that they know what you like,  what you don't like, where your home is, where your car is, and where you have been. Under the internet, you never own your privacy.</p>
