        <p>I remember when I was in middle school, everyone has their own "website" that comes from a common software called "QQ", and people usually put their journals, photos, etc. However, most people don't use and post things there anymore even it still exists. For this project, I bring the style back here, which is neat and clean. And also, I insert the same thing that I liked to put in that web page, which is all about my favorite singer, JJ Lin.</p>

        <p>Most company are collecting data while you are using the internet, so that they know what you like,  what you don't like, where your home is, where your car is, and where you have been. Under the internet, you never own your privacy.</p>
